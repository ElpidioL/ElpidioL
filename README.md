- Hi, I’m @ElpidioL or TheBlackCake

- I’m interested in programming in general, I like Games and Animes but anything tech related can catch my eyes 

- I’m currently focused on some front end skills and trying to make some repositories on github with python and GO

- My knowledge right now is: HTML, CSS, JS, TYPESCRIPT, C#, PYTHON, GO, POWERAPPS, REACT (I'm Not a pro, just used all of these for small individual projects, but i learn really fast)

- How to reach me: for now there is not many ways to do so, but you can contact me on Discord: TheBlackCake#8549 or email: lomeuelpidio@gmail.com (preference to discord)
    but I have intentions to expand this later on
 
- Thanks for reading this :) hope you have a good day
